### Intellij and OpenAI

this is my first plugin for IntelliJ. 8 hours ago I didn't have a clue about how to code a plugin for intellij.

90% of the code has been generated by chatgpt... can you imagine? A plugin that generate code written by what's powering the plugin

I was very upset that all the plugins which uses openai models just open a webview on the right. This plugin generate codes straight in the editor.

### Setup

1) download the jar from the [release page](https://github.com/iGio90/IntelliJ-OpenAI/releases).
2) install as a regular plugin from disk ([read here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html))
3) click the tools menu -> OpenAI Preferences and insert your api key

### Or build it yourself

```
./gradlew shadowJar

get the jar from build/libs/xxx.jar
```

### How to

simply add a comment in your editor with that format:

```python
# code a function that sum 2 numbers.
```

```java
// code a function that sum 2 numbers
```

and so on for all other languages. **NOTE** that the first word ``code`` and the last ``.`` are used as input/output

### Bonus

- auto-detect the language of the current file
- auto indent
