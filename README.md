### Intellij and OpenAI

this is my first plugin for IntelliJ. 8 hours ago I didn't have a clue about how to code a plugin for intellij.

~~90% of the code has been generated by chatgpt... can you imagine? A plugin that generate code written by what's powering the plugin~~

Thanks to chatgpt which introduced me to intellij plugin development and coded the first snippet of this plugin :heart:

I was very upset that all the plugins which uses openai models just open a webview on the right. This plugin generate codes straight in the editor.

### Setup

1) download the jar from the [release page](https://github.com/iGio90/IntelliJ-OpenAI/releases).
2) install as a regular plugin from disk ([read here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html))
3) click the tools menu -> OpenAI Preferences and insert your api key

### Or build it yourself

```
./gradlew shadowJar

get the jar from build/libs/xxx.jar
```

### How to

comment in your editor with that format:

```python
# code a function that sum 2 numbers.

# code a class which has 2 static string named X and Y and its getter and setters.
```

```java
// code a function that sum 2 numbers.

// code a class which has 2 static string named X and Y and its getter and setters.
```

and so on for all other languages. 

### keywords:

#### generating code:
``code`` query ``.`` or ``generate code`` query

### documenting classes and methods 
``document.`` or ``document`` query ``.`` or ```generate doc``` 

right before the code to document

### fixes for empty lines, indent, lint and code style
``apply lint`` or ``apply style`` 

**NOTE:** all of the keywords listed together perform the same actions
